# Holt Winters Model Research

Personal research into the Holt Winters model for Time Series Forecasting. The Notebook file contains visualizations, theory, mathematical background, and code examples in Python. Research is first performed on the smaller model components that Holt Winters consists of to understand why it's also referred to as triple exponential smoothing, and then finally Holt Winters itself. In order, the researched models are:

- Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
- Holt's Exponential Smoothing (HES)
- Winter's Exponential Smoothing (WES)

Holt Winters equations for its additive and multiplicative variations:
